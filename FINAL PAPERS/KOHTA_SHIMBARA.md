## Abstract
GreenRoute is an open-source computer program that enables motorists, cyclists, and transport firms to select routes that are lower in greenhouse-gas emissions without sacrificing convenience or price. The website integrates real-time traffic, elevation profile, vehicle efficiency lines, energy-grid carbon intensity, and public-charging availability to calculate the "greenest" route between point A and point B. In doing so, it completes an essential gap in the proprietary navigation tools currently on offer, which the majority of optimise for either speed or distance and reveal neither method nor data for public scrutiny. This document describes the project and more importantly, how it will be governed, made, and kept in working-open principles. Having covered the motivation for carbon-conscious routing, I then outline GreenRoute's vision, minimum viable feature set, and habits for keeping the code base, community, and funding model healthy over time. Ethical, legal, and business issues are addressed along with a lifecycle and sustainability plan to shield against maintainer burnout. The discussion shows that prudent open-source project management is as crucial as technical design in bringing a promising idea to life and making it a resilient climate-tech commons.
